This is an example project showing how swift can be used to filter and save a video file to the camera roll.

I used Brad larson's GPUImage software to complete this project.

The View Controllers were written in swift and that's were almost all of my work was at in this project.

Some example code was hand converted from Objective-C.

It's very basic at the moment.. just a demo really. But it does work if you want to try it.
